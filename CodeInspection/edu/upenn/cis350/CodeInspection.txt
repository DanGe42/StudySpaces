//Major Issue: no comments anywhere

//Inspected by: Cory
1. APIAcessor.java - getStudySpaces()
  -lots of Message Chains
    -lots of getJSONObject().get...
    -line 39: calling getJSONObject(k) a lot, just store that object somewhere
      -this functionality  

    -the reader instantiation is a bit long
      -could put the url in its own variable, then build the readers
  -StudySpace constructor has a long paramter list
    -could just pass the relevant objects and fetch their details in the
    constructor
  -lots of duplicate variable names (temp is a common one)
    - "t" also tells us nothing about the array it refers to

//Inspected by: Cory
2. StudySpace.java - getGSRNames()
  -don't need to call getter methods when inside the class (makes code longer)
  -could use a switch statement in the for loop (would be faster)
  -ArrayList names could be more descriptive

//Uses JSON parsing
3. Room.java - getAvailability()

//Very Long
4. StudySpaceListActivity.java - getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)

//Very long
5. TabDetails.java - onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState)
